    <h1>Mindstate Ideation Hackathon: Experience and Takeaways</h1>

    <h2>What is the MindState Ideation Hackathon?</h2>
    <p>The MindState Ideation Hackathon is a week long ideation sprint coordinated by MindState, where students from
      different schools collaborate to ideate and pitch a product in a competition. For this hackathon, MindState paired
      with BlueWhite, an innovative Ag Tech company, for students from Cornell Tech, Shenkar Institute, and UDEM to work
      with and ideate in the Ag Tech space. Four topics - Labor Forces, Environmental Resilience, Mental Health,
      Autonomous Fleet Management - were established and a group of students were assigned (based on student preference)
      to each topic, with each group having three students from Cornell Tech and 3 designers from both Shenkar and UDEM,
      as well as a mentor from
      BlueWhite. The groups work with each other in the month leading up to the week long sprint held in the Bay Area
      where they meet each other in person for the first time. It's an exciting opportunity to learn more about how to
      develop a product in a short amount of time with the guidance of an expert at the paired company.</p>

    <h2>Month Long Preparation</h2>
    <p>About a month before the trip to the Bay Area, I got the notification that I was placed in the Environmental
      Resilience group (my first choice!). I got to meet my fellow Cornell Tech teammates in person at our first
      meeting, while the students from Shenkar and UDEM and our mentor from BlueWhite connected with us from Zoom. The
      first meeting informed us of who our teammates and mentor would be, as well as a workshop with guest speakers who
      spoke about important factors to think about during the ideation process. We came up with preliminary ideas and
      honed in on the specific problems that we could address within the environmental resilience space. </p>
    <p>Subsequent meetings consisted of first defining specific problems and then further developing initial ideas. We
      identified three core problems within environmental resilience - </p>
